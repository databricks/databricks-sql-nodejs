/**
 * Example: Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Token Federation with Service Principal
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use token federation with a service
 * principal or machine identity. This is useful for server-to-server
 * authentication where there is no interactive user.
 *
 * When using M2M federation, you typically need to provide a client_id
 * to identify the service principal to Databricks.
